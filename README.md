The application / page can be accessed at: 

The following imame shows the application's appearance and functionilty:

The application has navigation links along the top called About, Portfolio, Contact and Resumé. Clicking any of these links will change the body of the page to refelct the content as follows:

The About Me, as well as the default page view, shows the biographical details of the developer.  
The Portfolio page shows a list of six projects that the developer has created. Clicking on the picture will take you to the deployed site for that project. In the footer of each project card, there is a link each project's repository.  
The Contact page shows a form, where a name, e-mail and message can be completed. If the e-mail is not valid, when compared with a regular expression, an error message will appear. If there is no message when the form is submitted, an error will display. As the site does not have any functional backend, the form simply thanks the user for their message, but does nothing else at this point.  
The resumé page show the developer's resumé and also represents a link for the resumé to be downloaeded.
